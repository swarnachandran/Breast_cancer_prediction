Breast-cancer is among the most serious illnesses/diseases, causing many deaths in the current situation.  Due to changes in food and lifestyle, the number of cancer cases in women is increasing day by day. It is the second most common cause of death in women in the world. 

Aim: 
   To provide the accurate prediction of the presence of the breast tumor by suing the concepts of Deep neural networks and classification algorithms based on the data obtained.
