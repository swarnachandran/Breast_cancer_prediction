# Breast_cancer_prediction
Breast-cancer is among the most serious illnesses/diseases, causing many deaths in the current situation.  Due to changes in food and lifestyle, the number of cancer cases in women is increasing day by day. It is the second most common cause of death in women in the world. 

Aim: 
   To provide the accurate prediction of the presence of the breast tumor by suing the concepts of Deep neural networks and classification algorithms based on the data obtained.

Motivation:

The idea that motivated me to take this problem statement is the present percentage of women suffering from the breast cancer and to help them out by building an tool to predict the severity of the disease. 


Dataset:

There are 30 features that was extracted to describe characteristics of cell nuclei present in the scanned images. The dataset consists of 569 patients ,212 have an outcome of malignancy and 357 are Benign. The classes in the dataset are separated into 2 or 4 groups, with 2 corresponding to the benign case and 4 corresponding to the malignant case![image](https://github.com/swarnachandran/Breast_cancer_prediction/assets/74671975/5d586f7d-f3e1-45da-b1c8-b6678afed8e8)

Conclusion:

I performed logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, MLP classifier and deep neural network on prediction of breast cancer. Among the 5 models, logistic regression model performs the best with the highest score of 0.98901. This models predicts the best value of the target variable.
